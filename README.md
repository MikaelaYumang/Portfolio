# My First Portfolio Website

This is my first personal portfolio website created during my second year as a Computer Engineering student at Holy Angel University. It showcases some of my early projects, skills, and achievements as I began my journey in web development and software engineering.

## About the Project

This portfolio was developed using **Python** and the **Django framework**. It includes multiple pages to present:
- My personal introduction
- A list of my skills

- Contact page for inquiries

The goal of this project was to learn the basics of full-stack development and create a space to document my growth as a future engineer.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Django**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **SQLite3** (default Django database)
- **Bootstrap** (for responsive design)
